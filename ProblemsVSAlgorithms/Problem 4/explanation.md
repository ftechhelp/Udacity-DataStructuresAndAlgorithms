## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
Basically we go through the array and if the position we are at is a 0 we send it to the beginning of the array and if it's a 2 we send it to the end of the array and then we end up with all the 1's in the middle

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the size of the array

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(1) since we are swaping the values in place.
