## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
Here we used a Trie to implement a simple HTTP router. I ended up putting more of the path splitting logic into the RouteTrie class to simplify the Router.

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the number of path parts

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the number of routes added
