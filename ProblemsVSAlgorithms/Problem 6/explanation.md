## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
This problem seemed weirdly easy? So I hope I understood what was required properly. No sorting was required. All you had to do was keep track of the minimum and maximum and then update them \
as you went down the array.

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the size of the array

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(1) since we are just updating minimum and maximum variables
