## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
Here we used a Trie to implement a simple HTTP router. I ended up putting more of the path splitting logic into the RouteTrie class to simplify the Router.

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(nm) where n is the total number of nodes and m is the average length of words/suffixes

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity of the solution is O(nm) where n is the total number of nodes and m is the average length of words/suffixes
