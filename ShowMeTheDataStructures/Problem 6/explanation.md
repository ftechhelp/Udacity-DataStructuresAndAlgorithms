## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
I converted the linked lists into sets and then used the python's built in union and intersection functions to solve the problem. /
I then converted them back into linked lists and returned it.

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity for union and intersection functions is O(n + m), where n and m is the length of the inputed linked lists.

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity for union and intersection functions is O(n + m), where n and m is the length of the inputed linked lists.
