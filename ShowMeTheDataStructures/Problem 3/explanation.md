## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
The implementation uses a priority queue to efficiently build the Huffman tree, ensuring that nodes with lower frequencies are combined first. 

## Time Efficiency:
The worst-case time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the Huffman tree construction.

## Space Efficiency:
The worst-case space complexity of the solution O(n + k), where n is the length of the input string and k is the number of unique characters.
